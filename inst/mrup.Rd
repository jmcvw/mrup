\title{Manage recent projects}
\usage{
mrup()
}
\description{
An add-in for managing the RStudio recently used projects list. It allows
projects to be added to, or removed from the recent project drop-down menu.
It also makes it possible to rename existing projects without navigating file
system manually.
}
\details{
The three functions of the app are each accessed through a dedicated tab at
the bottom of the window.
}
\section{Remove tab}{


  The RStudio menu shows a list of the 10 most recently used projects. This
  is based on the project_mru file which may contain more than 10 projects
  (apparently 15 max?). The remove tab lists the entire contents of the
  project_mru file, and allows any of them to be removed. The benefit of this
  is that is is possible to see which projects were recently removed.

  Pressing the \code{Remove} button creates a modified list to replace the
  current list. Replacement only takes place if the \code{Save changes}
  button is pressed.
}

\section{Add tab}{


  All subdirectories of the \code{~/R} directory are searched for
  \code{.Rproj} files, and will likely take a few seconds to complete. On
  Windows systems it is possible to specify a different directory (but see
  note below).

  Once done, a list is generated that indicates how long it has been since
  each project was modified. Selected projects are shown in a table that also
  shows the full path to the project. Pressing \code{Cancel} closes the app
  without making any changes

  Pressing the \code{Add} button creates a list with all selected projects
  placed at the top of the project list. Replacement only takes place if the
  \code{Save changes} button is pressed. Pressing \code{Cancel} closes the
  app without making any changes

  Since the list can only show 10 projects, those further down will be
  removed, but will stay on the project_mru file (for a while at least).

  \strong{NB:} Four points to be aware of when selecting a different directory to search.

  \enumerate{
    \item{It may take several seconds to locate all project files (even in the default location).}
    \item{Sometimes the "Choose directory" dialogue windows opens behind the RStudio window.}
    \item{Pressing the link more than once will cause several "Choose dir" windows to open.}
    \item{Currently an error is triggered under the following
  situations:}
    \itemize{
      \item{Selecting a directory without either at least one sub-directory or a \code{.Rproj} files.}
      \item{Pressing cancel on the choose directory
  dialogue.}
      \item{These errors can be dealt with by refreshing the app (the refresh button at top right).}
    }
  }
}

\section{Rename tab}{


  Because searching for all files takes some time, only projects already on
  the list can be renamed. Using the refresh button allows the list to be
  updated without restarting the add-in. When renaming, select 1 project and
  enter the new name in the box, without a file extension. As long as the
  project directory has the same name as the project itself, both shall be
  renamed, and the \code{.Rproj} extension will remain.

  The name change is implemented immediately on pressing \code{Rename}, with
  no need to press \code{Save changes}, and without the ability to cancel. To
  undo a rename, the project can be re-renamed straight away.

  There may be instances where the project has a name that is different from
  the containing directory. In this case only the \code{.Rproj} file (and
  therefore the preject itself) is renamed. If it is desired that the names
  be made the same, changing the \code{.Rproj} first to match the directory,
  then renaming again to the desired name will result in both the directory
  and project aquiring the new name.
